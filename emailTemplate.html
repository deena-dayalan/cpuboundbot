            Dear {{.UserName}},
            <br><br>
            We have noticed that you're running CPU-intensive processes on one of the login nodes({{.HostName}}), as detailed below.
            <br>
        </p>    
            <pre>{{.Message}}</pre>
        <p style="font-family:calibri;">
            CPU usage: {{.Usage}}
            <br>
            You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users. 
            Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: <a href="https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/get_started/connect.html#next-steps">Next steps</a>.
            <br><br>
            If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. 
            Please see our documentation on how to do this: <a href="https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html">Using sbatch</a>; <a href="https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html">Using srun</a>.
            <br><br>
            If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information:
